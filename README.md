# Brain Tumor Detection with Multimodal Language Models and Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Neuro-Oncology Imaging

This repository contains code for comparing the performance of **conventional Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **reasoner LLMs** in analyzing brain tumor MRI images. The goal is to evaluate their diagnostic accuracy and reasoning capabilities.

The project is part of the paper/review:  
**"Multimodal Large Language Models and Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Neuro-Oncology Imaging"**  
*(Victor Emanuel da Silva Monteiro, 2025)*
